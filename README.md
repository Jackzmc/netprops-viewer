# netpropsviewer

An easy way to view the netprops from any game that sourcemod can dump a netprops.xml file for.

Three games are already added: L4D2, CSGO, TF2. In the future, custom file uploading maybe supported.

Current demo/live site is: https://jackz.me/netprops, this should have up to date l4d2 stats, possibly csgo.
